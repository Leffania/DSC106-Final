    <h3>Choropleth:</h3>
    <h4>Identify states that lie within the extremes of frequency of canceled and delayed
        flights (states that have few to none canceled or delayed flights and those with
        numerous canceled or delayed flights):</h4>
    <div id="choropleth_answer"> 
        The reason we chose our color scheme is because our cancelled / delayed flights are sequential in grouping so we chose to use luminence.
         The marks and channels on the graph are lines to draw the states, position to distinguish between states, and color to show value.

    <h3>Stacked Bar Chart:</h3>
    <div id="stacked_bar_chart">

        <h4>Compare the similarities between airlines on how often they are on-time / early,
            cancelled, or delayed:</h4>
        <div id="stacked_bar_answer"> 
        The reason we chose our color scheme because our stacked bar chart has three different categories for being
         prompt, delayed, or cancelled so we chose 3 different hues.
          There is also some degree of ordering so the hues we chose to use green, yellow, red, which represent go, slow, stopped.
           The marks and channels on the graph are lines to draw the bars, position to position the lines to represent the flights, and color to distinguish flight type.

        <div id="scatter_plot_answer"> 
        We choose to outline our points and lower opacity so that we could visualize the stacks of points.
          The magenta line also contrasts the cyan points.
           The marks and channels on the graph are line to draw the regression line, points to plot the scatter points,
            position to position the line and points, and color for style.

    <h3>Histogram:</h3>
    
    <div id="histogram">
        
        <h4>Present a distribution of expected proportion of canceled or delayed flights for a
            given airline while doing an A/B test to determine if the airline has an impact on
            whether or not a flight will be cancelled or delayed:</h4>
        <h5>Null Hypothesis: The proportion of cancelled / delayed flights for Southwest Airlines is about the same as that of other airlines. </br>
            Alternative Hypothesis: The proportion of cancelled / delayed flights for Southwest Airlines is greater than that of other airlines. </br>
            We performed an A/B test with 100 simulations to see the distribution of the proportion of Cancelled / Delayed Flights to our target airline,
             Southwest Airlines. We then plotted a red point to represent the observed proportion, our p-value is: <a id="histogram_p_value"> </a> </br>
            Reject Null Hypothesis: <a id = "histogram_conclusion"> </a> 
        </h5>
        </div>
        <div id="histogram_answer"> 
        We choose to color our bars blue so that it would contrast with the red dot representing our observed proprtion.
          The marks and channels on the graph are line to draw the bars, points to plot the observed proportion, and position to position the line and points.

    <h3>Adjacency Matrix:</h3>

        </div>
        <h4>Derive the paths for flights from city to city that have been cancelled:</h4>
        <div id="matrix_answer"> 
        The reason we chose this color scheme in this graph because our value is binary in an adjaceny list so we decided to choose different hues,
         red and green which are complementary colors. Gray is used to represent the diagonal of nulls.
          The marks and channels on the graph are lines to draw the squares, position to position the squares,
           and color to represent the value of the adjacency matrix view.

        </div>
        
        <h4>Identify trends in flights during each month for West Coast states:</h4>
        <div id="matrix_answer"> 
        The reason we chose this color scheme in this graph because our groups are states which are categorical so we decided to choose different hues,
         blue, orange, and green. The marks and channels on the graph are areas to represent the number of flights, position to position the areas
          for each month, and color to represent each West Coast state. </br>
        Note: the flights dataset has no flights departing from the West Coast in October, so month 10 is omitted from the stream graph.
